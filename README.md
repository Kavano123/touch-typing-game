# touch-typing-game
I had created this game as I was also learning to type with all 10 fingers with touch typing. 
I was working at a training campus and this inspired me to create a game where other students could learn similar to how I learned it. 
I had base my project similar to how the site "10 fast fingers" were but not as complex. I made it the bare minimum becuase it didnt have to be complex for students to learn. 
I created the game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The reason I did it in this languages is becuase i wanted to implement it in our current E-Learning website so that our students could easily have access to it.
